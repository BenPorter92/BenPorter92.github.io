        <h2><b>The Expensive Nut's problem statement:</b></h2>
        <h3>Problem statement:</h3>
            <p>Users have difficulty juggling a multitude of private transportation apps when they need
            transportation in a city. They feel like it would be easier to have one app that combines all
            private and public transportation in an area into one, easily accessible application.</p>
            <h3>Who experiences this problem?</h3>
            <p>Any tourist that is unfamiliar with the public/private transportation methods in a city as well as
            local residents that would like an easier time finding routes and prices without having to open
            many different apps.</p>
            <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
            <p>There are too many apps for transportation</p>
            <h3>Where is the problem present?</h3>
            <p>Anytime a user has to be cautious about the amount of time and money it takes to get
            somewhere.</p>
            <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
            <p>Users could find transport at much lower prices and much quicker so they could save money
            and time</p>
